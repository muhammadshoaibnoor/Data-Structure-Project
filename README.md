# 🃏 KLONDIKE SOLITAIRE

This repository contains the Klondike Solitaire card game developed as part of the Data Structures course project. The project focuses on designing, implementing, and analyzing a real-world card game with a graphical user interface (GUI) while respecting course constraints.

## 📌 Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to:
* Understand and implement the complete rules of Klondike Solitaire.
* Design multiple versions of the game under different architectural constraints.
* Analyze the effectiveness and limitations of each design approach.
* Develop an interactive GUI-based application in C++.

Three versions of the game are designed. One version is fully functional, while the others demonstrate partial implementations to support comparative analysis, as required by the project guidelines.

## 🎮 Game Description

Klondike is the classic solitaire game where the player attempts to move all cards from the Tableau and Stock to the Foundation piles.

### Rules Summary
* **The Tableau:** Cards are dealt into 7 columns. Only the top card of each column is face-up.
* **Building Piles:** You can move cards between columns in descending order with alternating colors (e.g., a Red 7 can be placed on a Black 8).
* **Foundations:** Four piles (one for each suit) must be built from Ace (lowest) to King (highest).
* **Empty Columns:** Only a King can be moved into an empty Tableau column.
* **Stock & Waste:** A stock pile provides extra cards that are moved to a waste pile for play.
* **Victory Condition:** The game is won when all 52 cards are moved into the four foundation piles.
